# getting-and-cleaning-data

This is the course project for Getting & Cleaning Data for February 2015.
See the Codebook for details on how the data exists, and is set up.

This requires 'plyr' and 'dplyr' libraries.
Please run 
```
install.packages('plyr')
```
and
```
install.packages('dplyr')
```
before executing.
